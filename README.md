# Trivia Quiz

[View the live project here.](https://miss-monkey.github.io/quiz/.)

For my Frontend Development milestone project I have created Trivia Quiz.

This quiz has 10 random general knowledge questions. Each question has 4 answer options. For each correct choice player gets 1 point.
 
## UX
 
Trivia quiz is easy to use. For quiz background I have chosen blue color as this color stimulates your mind and helps to focus.
Quiz has "End Game" and "Back To Main Page" buttons so user can end the game or start it over at any time.

### User Stories
For user stories I asked my friends' opinion who are real quiz fans.

- As a user, I want game instructions to be displayed, so that I can understand game before I start.
- As a user, I want easy navigation, so that I can end or start over the game at any time.
- As a user, I want to see correct answer after my choice.
- As a user, I want to see how many questions are answered and how many are left.
- As a user, I want to see my score at the end.

### Wireframes 
I used Balsamiq to design my project.

## Features

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.
- [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) to create design wireframes.
- [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5) to structure page.
- [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS) to style content.
- [Javascript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) to add interactivity and fetch questions data from open Trivia database.
- [JQuery](https://jquery.com) to simplify DOM manipulation.
- [GitHub](https://github.com/) to host the project.
- [GitPod](https://gitpod.io/) for project development.


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

### GitHub Pages
The project was deployed to GitHub Pages using the following steps:

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page), locate the "Settings" Button on the menu.
3. Scroll down the Settings page until you locate the "GitHub Pages" Section.
4. Under "Source", click the dropdown called "None" and select "Master Branch".
5. The page will automatically refresh.
6. Scroll back down through the page to locate the now published site link in the "GitHub Pages" section.

### Forking the GitHub Repository
By forking the GitHub Repository we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps:

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
